# Optimising an Existing Webpage

## Description

For this project, an existing webpage was optimised by adding semantic elements and alt attributes to improve accessibility standards. This involved optimising the HTML and CCS codes to make it more simplified.

## Usage

Open the webpage in your browser by following this link: https://tamzinc.github.io/challenge_week1/. It should open up a webpage that looks like this:


<img width="1792" alt="Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 22 07 59" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115940593/197629726-c30faeff-c59c-41e8-863f-802d8d20a897.png"> 


Next, open Chrome DevTools to view the optimised code. To do this you can either right-click and select the 'Inspect' option, or use shortcuts Command+Option+I (for macOS) or Control+Shift+I (for Windows). This will bring up a console either to left or bottom of your webpage in the browser where you will be able to review the code. 

You should be able to see something similar to this:

Make sure you're on the 'Elements' tab, from there you will be able to see all the HTML elements and attributes used to make this webpage more optimised and accessible. The box on the right with the 'Styles' tab selected shows the CSS styling that has been used for this webpage.
